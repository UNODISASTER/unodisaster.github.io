# What is UNODisaaster?

The Disaster Researchers in the College of Information Science and Technology at the University of Nebraska at Omaha are primarily concerned with engaging emergency management (EM) practice in FEMA Region 7 (Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska) to understand where technology could augment existing practice in order to enhance EM's ability to save lives. 

This work is primarily being done under 3 specific headings: 

1. [Crisis Informatics (What could be possible)](#CI-What)
2. [Science and Technology Integration (What is needed)](#STISIG)
3. [Training Development (How to integrate)](#Training)

Through these 3 premises, the work undertaken by this group of researchers, students, co-investigators, and practitioners tends to fall into numerous domains and disciplines including: 

* Sociology
* Information Science
* Human-Computer Interaction
* Anthropology
* Communication Studies
* Disaster Science
* Game Studies

What we seek to do is to unpack decades of practice; find what can be done immediately, in the near future, and in the distant future; and begin to re-pack practice with technological knowledge that has been developing outside of EM practice for a number of years. This re-packing will be done with training modules, insider knowledge as a practitioner, guidance for existing bachelors programs devoted to EM and Homeland Security, and tabletop exercises. 

It is important to note that we are not concerned with the bleeding edge of technology, but with minimal, stable, and robust technologies that can enhance existing procedures without adding overhead, specialized skills, or the need to hire IT professionals. This is important to note because we seek to translate computer science, information science, and other technical domains in such a way as to render their inner workings easily known, understandable, and configurable with minimal training. And so when we say, "augment" we mean to "augment" not replace or otherwise overwhelm with shiny new tools without an instruction manual. 

The place of EM in the zeitgeist, especially that of COVID, is as such that in the midst of disaster, it is sought after. Between disasters almost all interest disappears and while we are currently in an upward spring of natural hazards, we are not in an upward swing of protecting human societies from them. As such, we approach the practice of EM as the group responsible for trying to save us from ourselves; only, without money, resources, technology, or status.

## 1 - Crisis Informatics or What Could be Possible

The driving force for this work is through the domain of crisis informatics. It is a driving force because for over 15 years, the work done in and around the term, "[crisis informatics (CI)](https://tinyurl.com/crisisinformatics)" has failed to take hold in the spaces in and around Emergency Management. Yet, the techniques and tools CI has developed can provide useful new tools to EM. 

Crisis Informatics is primarily `“Concerned with the ways in which information systems are entangled with socio-behavioral phenomena connected to disasters, [the field of] crisis informatics offers a rich set of research methods and empirical opportunities for examining the consequences of the role of technology in mediating our relations with the world.” (Soden and Palen 2018)`

Yet, this is not what crisis informatics is. To be more direct, CI `“addresses sociotechnical concerns in large-scale emergency response. Additionally it expands consideration to include not only official responders (who tend to be the focus in policy and technology-focused matters), but also members of the public. It therefore views emergency response as a social system where information is disseminated within and between official and public channels and entities. Crisis informatics wrestles with methodological concerns as it strives to develop new theory and support informed development of ICT and policy.” (Palen, Anderson, Mark, Martin, Sicker, Palmer, Grunwald, 2009)`

So there are empirical possibilities with the domain of internet-communication technologies (ICT) broadly; however, many of those possibilities cannot be realized without engaging an increasingly important deficit within the EM realm. That deficit begins with the fact that practice has never required a computer. It continues through the "sameness" of all EM in the form of the [Incident Command System (ICS)](https://training.fema.gov/is/courseoverview.aspx?code=is-100.c) and the homogeneity of EM more generally. And it is all exacerbated by attempts to insert technology into practice without stakeholder engagement or basic ethnographic understanding of practice. 

As a result, all of these concerns, opportunities, methods, and consequences remain unanswered, unnoticed, and are mostly without consequence for EM. Mostly without consequence because the need grows daily. With each iteration of mobile device, chip, and innovation in ICTs, the average consumer moves away from telephone calls. They move to messaging apps, away from television to streaming media, and in conjunction with the growing threat provided by information communication technologies which was developed quickly and has created new types of vulnerabilities.

## 2 - Science and Technology Integration or What Could be Integrated with EM Practice+

One of the most powerful reasons for a lack of engagement with CI in EM is that there is little to no crossover between academia and practice. The result is that in order to better understand where and what could be integrated, there is a need to understand Emergency Management as it is currently practiced. To do this there are three distinct paths: 

1. Hire Graduate Students who work in EM and train them in crisis informatics techniques. 
2. Talk to EM practitioners about their lives, their jobs, and their practice. 
3. Become an emergency manager.

To 1, hiring graduate students interested in EM is easier said than done in that students in anything touching ICTs will be hyper-competitive in the market of ICTs, away from that of EM. To 2, this is the focal point of the work being done. Through this work, we can begin to make sense of where computation can aid EM in addition to understand the capacity of EM with regard to the potential tools. 

In understanding EM in this way, different types of design can be applied to develop tools that EM can use. This is of paramount interest to HCI and work surrounding machine learning, artificial intelligence, and other forms of automated sifting. Through practical deployment of AI, ML, or other automata, the shift from what is possible to what is necessary can help create new industries, new competitions, and other kinds of tools.

## 3 - Training Development or How to Integrate Technology with EM

EM does not currently have a path to professionalization. While there are some degree programs out there, the bulk of EM practitioners come from the armed forces, from emergency services, and other similar domains. As a result, any sort of shift in practice will need to occur not inside of college programs (though this will happen over time), but in places where practice is learned. Through training modules at places like the [Emergency Management Institute](https://training.fema.gov/emi.aspx), the [International Association of Emergency Management](https://www.iaem.org/), and the [National Emergency Management Association](https://www.nemaweb.org/).

In addition, training exercises [(outlined on Ready.gov)](https://www.ready.gov/exercises) can help bring existing practitioners on board as they learn about the theory of computational techniques while not actually being tasked to perform them. These exercises are routinized but have not embraced much of the experimentation or systems that have been created or developed inside of other realms devoted to games. 

Tabletop Role-Playing Games, Video Games, and everything in between has been in constant development since the early 1950s. This development is self-sustaining in the form of industries devoted to innumerable games but system development like this has resulted in innumerable experiments with users. This is useful for thinking about how to train EM personnel in using the technologies from crisis informatics. If these can embrace existing practice in systems design in any of the gaming industries we can better understand a number of aspects related to tabletop exercises. 

This includes: 

* Immersion
* Knowledge Transfer
* How systems mediate action
* How mixed media can be done cheaply and effectively
