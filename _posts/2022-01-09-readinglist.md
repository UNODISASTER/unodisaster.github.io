This semester marks Dr. LaLone's first with students. A routine activity Dr. LaLone has declared are to post weekly reading responses. There are 16 weeks in a semester. 

* Classes begin January 24
* Spring Break is March 12-16
* Finals are May 9-13

The result of these dates is that there are around 14 weeks of content. Responses will be due each Sunday. 

Each of the readings will be essential readings in content related to the focus of current research: tabletop games, emergency management, and crisis informatics. To be a bit higher level, since these two students are new, they will be readings from human-computer interaction, methods readings, and papers related to the research we will be doing.

The dates then are:
