The researchers associated with the University of Nebraska at Omaha believe that research and work should be public, processes available to read, reviews of cited pieces available to see, and op-eds about topical items available to all. 

As this is a University-oriented research space, the intent of this blog, webpage, and github repository is meant to provide 3 distinct pieces of training: 

1. Onboarding for graduate students. 
2. Capacity Building. 
3. Advertising of past, current, and future research.

As of 2022, the work and approaches we are engaged on are best described as: 

1. [Exploring what the current technical capabilities of emergency management are.](#curr_tech)
2. [Exploring the bare minimum approaches of machine learning, artificial intelligence, and information retrieval that can be used within those capabilities.](#min_approach) 
3. [Exploring what types of training could be possible given the history of tabletop role-playing games, vintage game approaches like PICO-8, and what technologies could fit into existing emergency management programs.](#type_training) 

Each of these approaches holistically relate to the [Integration of Science and Technology with Emergency Managment]() or a ground-up approach to helping to bridge the gap between consumer behavior and emergency management capabilities. The easiest way to explain this gap is to point to the proliferation of mobile devices and its impact on what everyday consumers will attempt to do when they are in danger.

Within this post, we outline current understanding of our work and will identify central readings we are using to center our own work.

## What are the current technical capabilities of emergency management?

In 2021 as a part of the Emergency Management Institute's Advanced Academy, Dr. LaLone administered a survey based on a survey from the International Association of Emergency Management's (IAEM) Emerging Technology Committee combined with an undergraduate computer science education survey instrument. The intent behind this survey was to understand: 

1. What technologies are currently in use within emergency management.
2. What technologies could be useful in emergency management. 
3. What do practitioners know how to do?

This work was carried out as an attempt to unpack current issues within the study of the potential of information communication technology that is primarily contained under the heading of "Crisis Informatics." For over 15 years, crisis informatics has attempt to show, develop, and release technologies for emergency management to use; however, practitioners rarely have glimpsed this work, let alone integrated it with practice.

## What are the bare minimum approaches of machine learning, artificial intelligence, and information retrieval?

The inverse of the above begins not with emergency management but with Data Science, Computer Science, and the various domains that engage data-driven practice. This work is important because the gap between consumer communication behaviors, expectations, and tools with that of emergency management capabilities needs more exploration than simply training emergency management better. Complex pipelines of dictionaries, procedures, and toolkits require enormous amounts of training, expertise, and fiddling. 

As a result, we seek to expand on calls for "practical" applications of machine learning, artificial intelligence, and information retrieval. Given the recent and growing popularity of each of these subdomains, little has been done on gaining an understanding of bare minimums that can be performed without training data, without complex pipelines, and without training in any way.

## What types of training could be possible?

Emergency Management is a new domain despite it being put into practice during the Kennedy administration in the 1960s. Over the past 60 years; however, little has been done to change the practice of responding to natural hazards and other types of disaster events. This is not because the field is slow to evolve, but because despite changes in technology resulting in new consumer behaviors, many of these changes are not present in the aftermath of disaster because information communication technology lacks resilience to nearly any kind of event or a sudden rise in demand given a disaster event / interruption of service. 

While this work is primarily focused on gathering syllabi, tabletop exercises, and other kinds of training materials, a lot of the work here falls under the domain commonly called, "game studies."
