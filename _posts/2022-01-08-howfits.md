As a researcher, much of my work is meant to fill a common products based on me and my perspectives on the focus of my research. This focus began in my childhood and was made manifest when I was in graduate school -- emergency management with a focus on tech and science integration. The breakdown of this work is relatively straight forward (for me) but may be slightly confusing, obtuse, convoluted, or otherwise nonsensical to you. 

The most basic description of this is best considered in a list of 5 steps: 

1. All things break but we do not design around this eventuality.
2. When things are broken, emergency management is responsible for dealing with that. 
3. Because all things are not built around being broken, computation of all forms cannot work within disaster. 
4. Yet, there is a need for computation within emergency management because consumers are coated in it and expect it to work. 
5. In order to fix the above 4 items, work needs to be done with regard to understanding how diasters differ from one another, how to train for a technological emergency management, and what content is needed.
