If the work being done here involves the future of emergency management (EM), what are the potential futures that we are already thinking about? 

It has to do with a gap between consumer behavior and We all have thoughts about where our lives, our jobs, our careers, and our cultures will go. 

Despite our best intentions, our language, our rhetorical tools, we do not travel or progress forward or backward, we shift here and there working on our abilities, our perspectives, and are constantly expanding our toolkit. Change is a constant yet EM has remained frozen in time for many, many years. Much of this is not a result of EM being tech averse, but for EM being unable to use technology because it simply cannot be used to do anything related to its charge. In fact, technology, or the infrastructure that makes information communication technology is the thing that often has to be responded to.
