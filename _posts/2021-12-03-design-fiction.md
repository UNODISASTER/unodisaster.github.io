Emergency management is a deeply entrenched practice with decades of After-Action Reports, Lessons Learned, and other forms of reifying practice, policy, procedure, and entry. While at its creation, emergency management reflected societal practice surrounding communication tool preferences, a gap began with the onset of mobile devices and was excacerbated as mobile devices gained robust application environments. As a result, the only way to envision emergency management that is once again aligned with consumer behaviors is to engage design fiction, a way of exploring potential futures through fiction meant to provoke specific scenarios through artifacts.

In order to understand how to begin to shift emergency management (EM), there are a number of steps that must be taken to contextualize EM in a way that can be understood by outside designers. Those steps are loosely: 

### Survey existing practitioners in order to understand what technologies they know, or could know how to use.

One of the biggest roadblocks to the intergration of technology with emergency management is the different ways that technology is made to fit within an existing use-space rather than within practice itself. Readings like, "The Right Mindset" get into this. This reading notes that: 

  > "Where a Western manager might go for a leading-edge application in the almost mystical belief that it would deliver a competitive advantage, a Japanese manager would look at performance goals and choose technology--whether old or new--that would help him achieve those goals."

And here, we see a rather unique space for development. If there is a gap between consumer behavior and emergency management capabilities, it isn't enough to just give emergency management the technologies to engage those technologies. This sort of hierarchically-oriented development, beginning with the technology itself or beginning with technologists hoisting things onto a practical space, works for many different spaces. Instead, there is a need to understand where technology can enhance performance without disrupting it or changing it completely. 

This approach is necessary because of 3 distinct realities: 

  * For EM, these technologies need to work without fiddling with them. 
  * For EM, technologies will not have reliable training data and cannot meet stable environments because disasters will vary by any local, state, or federal regulations, jurisdictions, and space of impact.
  * For EM, it is important for technologies to work without electricity, connectivity, and devices that can run custom firmware.

By embracing these realities, new technologies can enhance existing practice, jurisdictional spaces, and scale-as-needed. However, given the existing need to unpack certain kinds of things related to practice, some of this may change. First and foremost, practice needs to be understood far more in-depth. 

Coming back to design fiction, the use of reality to ground any and all types of fiction will help to aid their reflection of practice. In meeting these realities, in helping more accurately reflect practice, it is possible to create believable fiction that can be mutually worked toward. 

### Examine existing syllabi for the new and emerging EM programs to see what technologies are being taught. 

EM (and Homeland Security) bachelor, master, and PhD programs are still new. It is currently a reflection of practice that many basic levels of computation are not a part of these programs. As these capacities are not a prerequisite for being hired, there is little need to teach them. 

However, little has been done to systematically catalog existing technology-oriented courses in order to find their commonalities. By finding where programs do not differ, technical capacities can be amended to their existing delivery in order to open new avenues of development later. For example, in the [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/) spaces, the goals of the workshops that are a part of practice are meant to be absorbed and understood within a day or two. 

While these types of trainings are not in-depth and do not result in expertise-in-use, their function as capacity building cannot be denied. In offering a number of these courses over the course of a degree program will result in future scaffolding to build new types of practice upon. 

### Develop a number of design fictions independently of practice

Now, while we understand that we need to unpack practice in order to begin working toward a new or different reality of practice, there is an oppositional space of technological development that needs to be realized. In light of the technologist's perspective, top-down approaches, possibilities, and other forms of product specs should be developed in order to build capacity from the design-based perspectives. 

While these types of design documents and paper-prototypes are essentially the same as those mentioned above as being top-down and incorrect, there is little-to-no roadmap for any of these sorts of things and so artifacts like design documents can provide a useful way to test perspectives, assumptions, and early mental models of the design team, researchers, or firm. In approaching these in this way, existing assumptions are essentially outlined and can be compared against the results of the feedback gathered from the next step. 

### Gather practitioner feedback for a design fiction via interviews, streaming demonstrations, and various participatory design concepts 

A survey can provide some useful pieces of knowledge that exist across jurisdictions, types of EM, and other facets of practice; however, given the dearth of knowledge that exists within the practice of EM, a survey is not enough. As such, much of the work surrounding technological development of technologies that will work within existing practice needs to determine the qualities of practice. As such, qualitative methods like focus groups, interviews, and ethnography. 

Through these types of methods, we can not only expand on the initial survey, but begin to unpack some of the confusing portions of the results of that survey. This information is important to gather as the ways that practices overlap that neither practitioners can articulate nor academia or software developers can intuit can be made manifest. Through these data, more depth into practice can not only be found, but perhaps brought closer to the surface and enhanced either through technology or training. 


### Examine both DF in tandem to see overlap, gaps, and mutually beneficial spaces of development

Gathering data is one thing, analyzing it another, putting those data into use is something else altogether. Network analysis, thematic analysis, and various forms of qualitative measures can not only find commonalities, but also find the qualities of those commonalities. In this way, we meet Gabriel Tarde's approach of seeking what makes things similar as differemce, being different, is simply existance and seeking to underpin, to highlight, to reify those differences is only a way of widening gaps. 

With those identified, the seams of difference based on ICS, based on jurisdiction, and other forms of those things 

### Move from fiction toward reality through training, pedagogy, and tool development

Years of data collection, analysis, and digging deeper into EM practice will produce a variety of data. Analyzing those data will produce a number of insights. It is not enough to produce insights; instead, this work needs to attempt to produce proof-of-concept objects, prototypes, or various kinds of design fictions that are detailed enough for others to use. 

Further, it is additionally not enough to produce prototypes. The issue of the prototype resides in the, "Paradox of the active user" wherein users will never be anymore than mediocre with any product they are meant to use. While the reaction to this paradox was the manifestation of minimalism and the re-distribution of complexity in the face of designing software, the theater of use, the context of use, needs to be more than mediocre, less than expert, but always available without effort.

To manage this, lessons in the form of [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/) for these products can introduce swathes of users to the end of this work. In so doing this, we can provide more and more users with enough expertise to bring this back to their stations, their agencies, or their jurisdiction. In addition to these trainings, we can additionally provide all of the tools via USB drive, releases via a github repository, and additional information on future development post-training. Each of these methods of training paired with distribution will slowly result in a snowball effect resulting in (hopefully) a changing practice.
