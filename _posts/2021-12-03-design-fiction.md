Emergency management is a deeply entrenched practice with decades of After-Action Reports, Lessons Learned, and other forms of reifying practice, policy, procedure, and entry. While at its creation, emergency management reflected societal practice surrounding communication tool preferences, a gap began with the onset of mobile devices and was excacerbated as mobile devices gained robust application environments. As a result, the only way to envision emergency management that is once again aligned with consumer behaviors is to engage design fiction, a way of exploring potential futures through fiction meant to provoke specific scenarios through artifacts.

In order to understand how to begin to shift emergency management (EM), there are a number of steps that must be taken to contextualize EM in a way that can be understood by outside designers. Those steps are loosely: 

### Survey existing practitioners in order to understand what technologies they know, or could know how to use.

One of the biggest roadblocks to the intergration of technology with emergency management is the different ways that technology is made to fit within an existing use-space rather than within practice itself. Readings like, "The Right Mindset" get into this. This reading notes that: 

  > "Where a Western manager might go for a leading-edge application in the almost mystical belief that it would deliver a competitive advantage, a Japanese manager would look at performance goals and choose technology--whether old or new--that would help him achieve those goals."

And here, we see a rather unique space for development. If there is a gap between consumer behavior and emergency management capabilities, it isn't enough to just give emergency management the technologies to engage those technologies. This sort of hierarchically-oriented development, beginning with the technology itself or beginning with technologists hoisting things onto a practical space, works for many different spaces. Instead, there is a need to understand where technology can enhance performance without disrupting it or changing it completely. 

This approach is necessary because of 3 distinct realities: 

  * For EM, these technologies need to work without fiddling with them. 
  * For EM, technologies will not have reliable training data and cannot meet stable environments because disasters will vary by any local, state, or federal regulations, jurisdictions, and space of impact.
  * For EM, it is important for technologies to work without electricity, connectivity, and devices that can run custom firmware.

By embracing these realities, new technologies can enhance existing practice, jurisdictional spaces, and scale-as-needed. However, given the existing need to unpack certain kinds of things related to practice, some of this may change. First and foremost, practice needs to be understood far more in-depth. 

Coming back to design fiction, the use of reality to ground any and all types of fiction will help to aid their reflection of practice. In meeting these realities, in helping more accurately reflect practice, it is possible to create believable fiction that can be mutually worked toward. 

### Examine existing syllabi for the new and emerging EM programs to see what technologies are being taught. 

EM (and Homeland Security) bachelor, master, and PhD programs are still new. It is currently a reflection of practice that many basic levels of computation are not a part of these programs. As these capacities are not a prerequisite for being hired, there is little need to teach them. 

However, little has been done to systematically catalog existing technology-oriented courses in order to find their commonalities. By finding where programs do not differ, technical capacities can be amended to their existing delivery in order to open new avenues of development later. For example, in the [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/) spaces, the goals of the workshops that are a part of practice are meant to be absorbed and understood within a day or two. 

While these types of trainings are not in-depth and do not result in expertise-in-use, their function as capacity building cannot be denied. In offering a number of these courses over the course of a degree program will result in future scaffolding to build new types of practice upon. 

### Develop a number of design fictions independently of practice

Now, while we understand that we need to unpack practice in order to begin working toward a new or different reality of practice, there is an oppositional space of technological development that needs to be realized. In light of the technologist's perspective, top-down approaches, possibilities, and other forms of product specs should be developed in order to build capacity from the design-based perspectives. 

While these types of design documents and paper-prototypes are essentially the same as those mentioned above as being top-down and incorrect, there is little-to-no roadmap for any of these sorts of things and so artifacts like design documents can provide a useful way to test perspectives, assumptions, and early mental models of the design team, researchers, or firm. In approaching these in this way, existing assumptions are essentially outlined and can be compared against the results of the feedback gathered from the next step. 

### Gather practitioner feedback for a design fiction via interviews, streaming demonstrations, and various participatory design concepts 

A survey can provide some useful pieces of knowledge that exist across jurisdictions; however, given the dearth of knowledge that exists within the practice of EM, a survey is not enough. As such, much of the work surrounding technological development of technologies that will work within existing practice 

### Examine both DF in tandem to see overlap, gaps, and mutually beneficial spaces of development



### Move from fiction toward reality through training, pedagogy, and tool development
