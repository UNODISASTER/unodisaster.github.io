Starting in 2022, there will be some of the first graduate students that will begin working with the University of Nebraska at Omaha College of Information Science and Technology. An aspect of this work that is important is to understand the work done prior to their entry. 

Articles and posts like this one will serve to offer insights and potential lessons-learned from those students. Any new read can produce wisdom, and so we offer these readings to build capacity and onboard these students for more robust work.
