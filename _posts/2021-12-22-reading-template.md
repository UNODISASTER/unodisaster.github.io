Starting in 2022, there will be some of the first graduate students that will begin working with the University of Nebraska at Omaha College of Information Science and Technology. An aspect of this work that is important is to understand the work done prior to their entry. 

Articles and posts like this one will serve to offer insights and potential lessons-learned from those students. Any new read can produce wisdom, and so we offer these readings to build capacity and onboard these students for more robust work.

Dr. Brian Dorn will additionally provide these tips but they're useful to remember: 

* If you don't understand terms or techniques in a paper, look them up!
* Some papers we will explore this semester don't fully align with the standard "lab report" format.  In particular, literature surveys and more theoretical pieces come to mind.  Be thoughtful and adapt your reading strategies based on what kind of scholarly article it is you are reading.
* Read some helpful tips about how to read papers from other scientists in this Science piece by Elisabeth Pain: https://www.sciencemag.org/careers/2016/03/how-seriously-read-scientific-paper 
* Here's another take on CS reading papers from Dr. Madooei at the University of British Columbia: https://elearning.uniroma1.it/pluginfile.php/397233/mod_resource/content/2/ReadingAdvice.pdf

### Example: 

**Post Author:** Nick LaLone

**Title:** Paradox of the Active User

**Conference Proceedings or Publisher:** Chapter in Interfacing Thought: Cognitive Aspects of Human-Computer Interaction

**Year Published:** 1987

**Authors:** John (Jack) Carroll and Mary Beth Rosson

**Author's Affiliation:** Pennsylvania State University iSchool 

**Abstract:** Book Chapter so no Abstract

**Strengths:** This chapter focuses on the idea that humans were beginning to use computation in their everyday lives. It focuses on 2 distinct ideas: 

1. People have considerable trouble learning to use computers. 
2. When people do learn how to use computers, or software on the computer, they tend to be (at best) mediocre about it.

Whereas one could point out that this is due to "bad design," the truth is a bit more complicated. What design and designers often fail to do is consider what motivates a user to learn how to use a program. Moreover, it leads to a number of paradoxes. The first is that users will bring a desire to simply use a piece of software well enough to accomplish their intended task. The second paradox is that of "assimilation" or that folks will use their knowledge from similar software or the intended task of the software to its use. They will apply these pieces of knowledge to the software at hand and find ways to make the software do what they want rather than discover all that the designers placed within it. 

The rest of the article discusses potential ways to get around these paradoxes because they cannot be solved. "Everyone is an expert, but not in the software before them" and that ground truth makes it hard to overcome the paradoxes because it results in folks using that knowledge rather than reading documentation or learning how to use things the way they were intended to be. While these paradoxes cannot be overcome, the approaches outlined in the text align with the author's development of the now uniquitous minimalistic design or designing systems that contain just 1 task in mind.

**Weaknesses:** There are a number of weaknesses with these concepts but at the time of publication, they would not have seemed that way. First, the result of undoing the complexity of software is as such that designing for minimalism allows designers to focus users in a way that gets folks using their software immediately. For example, my email client just does email. My Facebook app just goes to facebook. I use Sublime to write and that's all it does. Unfortunately, the tradeoffs for this is that we took increasingly complicated software and re-distributed that complexity. In the midst of the mobile revolution, this complexity has taken the form of software, of apps that do one thing and cannot communicate with other apps. Newly complex app-based ecosystems have not come full circle to what this article meant to discuss. 

Next, it focuses on users in a way that tends to call them stupid. While it is true that users will attempt to just use a thing, this was seen as a thing to stamp down, not to celebrate. As a result, this article widens the gap between users and creators. 

**Uses in our work:** Since we are dealing with folks who have never used software outside of being a user (as in, they are not programmers), this piece and its history are useful when approaching ways to integrate technology with emergency management. While much of the paradox is bypassed in most ways, our work in EM is as such that the paradox needs to be re-encountered and reconsidered for disaster-based use.
