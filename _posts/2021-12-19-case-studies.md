After-Action Reports (AAR), Case Studies, and the assembled wisdom of a response effort is often assembled after the action is done. These reports are shared, discussed, and used on occassion for tabletop exercises but it is rare to see multiple AARs, case studies, or institutional knowledge assembled and used to make better sense of emergency management (EM) as a whole.
